abstract: "Innovation policy is important to sustainable development. However,
  few scholars have paid attention to the impact of Comprehensive Innovation
  Reform Pilot (CIRP) Zone Policy on urban green innovation efficiency. To fill
  this gap, this paper uses difference-in-differences and robustness tests to
  explore the impact of CIRP on urban Green Innovation Efficiency (GIE) in 275
  cities in China from 2008 to 2017. The impacts are investigated in terms of
  the innovation-driven effect, talent cluster effect, and market effect. The
  results show that: (1) the impact of CIRP on the GIE of pilot cities
  significantly increased by 12% from 2008 to 2017, indicating that the
  innovation policy for sustainable development has an important positive effect
  on urban green innovation; (2) CIRP has improved the overall innovation level
  and talent cluster, accelerated the marketization process, and promoted the
  GIE of the pilot cities; and (3) the analysis of urban heterogeneity showed
  that CIRP has a greater impact on GIE in central cities in China than in
  western and eastern cities. The impact on GIE in low-administrative-level
  cities is greater than in high-administrative-level cities. It is suggested
  that the government takes the lead in green innovation and improves the talent
  introduction measures and green financial services. Achieving green innovation
  and development is the common goal of many countries around the world. The
  research results provide implications about introducing innovative policies
  for sustainable development in other countries and regions, especially
  developing countries that face the dilemma between economic growth and
  environmental protection."
