abstract: Short-term load forecasts are important tools for electrical utilities
  to balance electricity supply and demand. The exponential increase in
  behind-the-meter solar panel installation in California has made it more
  difficult to accurately predict electrical load. This study developed three
  forecast models based on multiple linear regression, random forest, and
  gradient boosting that incorporated solar capacity to predict hourly load in
  southern California 24-h in advance. Air temperature was the most important
  meteorological variable and holiday, month, solar capacity and the load from
  the previous week were the most important non-meteorological variables. All
  three models were more accurate when load was lower, such as early morning,
  late at night and during the winter. In contrast, all models had larger errors
  during the middle of the day and in summer when load was higher. The mean
  error, based on the forecasts for each hour of the day, was 3.5% for the
  random forest, 3.4% for the multiple linear regression, and 3.1% for the
  gradient boosting. Overall, the gradient boosting model performed the best and
  had errors <2% during the early morning and late evening. This study provides
  insights on short-term load forecasting in locations with a significant
  increase in solar generation..
