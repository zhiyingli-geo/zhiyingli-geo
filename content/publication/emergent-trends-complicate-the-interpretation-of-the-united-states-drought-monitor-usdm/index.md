abstract: Effective drought management must be informed by an understanding of
  whether and how current drought monitoring and assessment practices represent
  underlying nonstationary climate conditions, either naturally occurring or
  forced by climate change. Here we investigate the emerging climatology and
  associated trends in drought classes defined by the United States Drought
  Monitor (USDM), a weekly product that, since 2000, has been used to inform
  drought management in the United States. The USDM classifies drought intensity
  based in part on threshold percentiles in key hydroclimate quantities. Here we
  assess how those USDM-defined drought threshold percentiles have changed over
  the last 23 years, examining precipitation, runoff, soil moisture (SM),
  terrestrial water storage (TWS), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and
  near-surface air temperature. We also assess underlying trends in the
  frequency of drought classifications across the U.S. Our analysis suggests
  that the frequency of drought class occurrence is exceeding the threshold
  percentiles defined by the USDM in a number of regions in the United States,
  particularly in the American West, where the last 23 years have emerged as a
  prolonged dry period. These trends are also reflected in percentile-based
  thresholds in precipitation, runoff, SM, TWS, VPD, and temperature. Our
  results emphasize that while the USDM appears to be accurately reflecting
  observed nonstationarity in the physical climate, such trends raise critical
  questions about whether and how drought diagnosis, classification, and
  monitoring should address long-term intervals of wet and dry periods or
  trends.
