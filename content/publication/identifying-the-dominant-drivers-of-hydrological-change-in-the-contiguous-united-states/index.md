abstract: Understanding the dominant drivers of hydrological change is essential
  for water resources management. Watersheds in the United States are
  experiencing different types of changes (e.g., wet gets wetter and dry gets
  drier); however, few studies have analyzed what drivers are responsible for
  these changes, and how the dominant drivers vary over time and as a function
  of the climate/water regime and land cover. This study uses a time-varying
  Budyko framework to quantify the relative importance of precipitation,
  potential evapotranspiration, and other factors (e.g., climate seasonality,
  agricultural drainage, and urbanization) in 889 watersheds in the contiguous
  United States from 1950 to 2009. Results show that watersheds that are getting
  wetter are primarily due to increases in precipitation. However, watersheds in
  dry climates that are getting drier are primarily due to other factors, while
  watersheds in wet climates that are getting drier are primarily due to
  precipitation. The drivers causing statistically significant streamflow trends
  vary depending on dominant land-use types. Temporally, the increasing effects
  of other factors are more pronounced after the 1980s in the Midwest. The
  dominant drivers of streamflow in the United States are time-varying instead
  of constant. This is consistent with non-stationary patterns of streamflow.
  The time-varying drivers provide information on the processes that are
  increasingly important and require the most attention in water resources
  management.
