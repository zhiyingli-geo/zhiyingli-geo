abstract: Predicting future streamflow change is essential for water resources
  management and understanding the impacts of projected climate and land use
  changes on water availability. The Budyko framework is a useful and
  computationally efficient tool to model streamflow at larger spatial scales.
  This study predicts future streamflow changes in 889 watersheds in the
  contiguous U.S. based on projected climate and land use changes from 2040 to
  2069. The temporal variability of surface water balance controls, represented
  by the Budyko ω parameter, was modeled using multiple linear regression,
  random forest, and gradient boosting. Results show that random forest is the
  optimal model and can explain >85% of the variance in most watersheds.
  Relative cumulative moisture surplus, forest coverage, crop land and urban
  land are the most important variables of the time-varying ω in most
  watersheds. There are statistically significant increases in mean annual
  precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and ω in 2040-2069, as compared
  to 1950-2005. This leads to a statistically significant decrease in the runoff
  ratio (Q/P). Streamflow is projected to decrease in the central, southwestern,
  and southeastern United States and increase in the northeast. These
  projections of water availability which are based on future climate and land
  use change scenarios can inform water resources management and adaptation
  strategies.
