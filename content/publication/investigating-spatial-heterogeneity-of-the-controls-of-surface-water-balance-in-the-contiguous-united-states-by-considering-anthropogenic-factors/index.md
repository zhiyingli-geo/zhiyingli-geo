abstract: Understanding how precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration
  and streamflow is important for assessing water availability. In the Budyko
  framework, this partitioning is quantified through the ω parameter. Previous
  studies have modeled the physical representation of ω; however, the spatial
  heterogeneity of the relationship between ω and the variables that it
  represents has not been investigated. This study uses a geographically
  weighted regression model to identify spatial variations in the factors that
  control the water balance in 126 reference watersheds with minimal human
  disturbance and 765 non-reference watersheds in the continental United States.
  Results show that snowfall and forest coverage are important predictors of ω
  in the reference watersheds. Relative cumulative moisture surplus, dam
  storage, and developed land in riparian areas are important predictors in
  non-reference watersheds. Climate is a primary control of the relative
  importance of forest coverage. The importance of forest coverage is greater in
  arid watersheds than in humid watersheds. Snowfall is more important than
  forest coverage in the Northeast and Midwest. This study demonstrates that dam
  construction and urban sprawl have a significant impact in non-reference
  watersheds. Dam storage is the most important predictor in 21% of the
  non-reference watersheds, and riparian developed land is more important in 13%
  of the non-reference watersheds. Overall, there are statistically significant
  relationships between climatic, physiographic, and human-related factors and
  the ω parameter. The spatial variations in the relationship quantified in this
  study can help to improve regional watershed management.
