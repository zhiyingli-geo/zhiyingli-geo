abstract: As the microsubjects of transformation and upgrading, enterprises are
  conducting green innovation to help simultaneously improve economic and
  environmental quality. However, whether green innovation can promote green
  total factor productivity (GTFP) remains unclear, especially at a micro level.
  This study addresses this research gap from an empirical perspective, focusing
  on Chinese A-share listed enterprises and using economic and environmental
  statistical data at the province and city levels from 2004 to 2019. Results
  show that green innovation improves GTFP. The impact of green innovation on
  GTFP is heterogeneous, depending on patent types and characteristics of
  enterprises. Additionally, technical gaps influence the impacts of green
  innovation on enterprise GTFP. It has a threshold effect in heavy-pollution
  enterprises. Green innovation inhibits enterprise GTFP when the technical gap
  is less than 132.7233. When the technical gap is more than 142.4535, green
  innovation promotes the enterprise GTFP. Our research provides microscopic
  evidence on green transformation for enterprises with heterogeneous
  characteristics and green innovation.
