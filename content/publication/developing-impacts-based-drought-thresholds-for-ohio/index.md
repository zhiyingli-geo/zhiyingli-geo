abstract: "Drought monitoring is critical for managing agriculture and water
  resources and for triggering state emergency response plans and hazard
  mitigation activities. Fixed thresholds serve as guidelines for the United
  States Drought Monitor (USDM). However, fixed drought thresholds (i.e., using
  the same threshold in all seasons and climate regions) may not properly
  reflect local conditions and impacts. Therefore, this study develops
  impacts-based drought thresholds that are appropriate for drought monitoring
  in Ohio. We examined four drought indices that are currently used by the State
  of Ohio: Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized
  Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmerâ€™s Z-Index and Palmer
  Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI). Streamflow and corn yield are used as
  indicators of hydrological and agricultural drought impacts, respectively. Our
  results show that fixed thresholds tend to indicate milder drought conditions
  in Ohio, while the proposed impacts-based drought thresholds are more
  sensitive to exceptional drought (D4) conditions. The area percentage of D4
  based on impacts-based drought thresholds is more strongly correlated with
  corn yield and streamflow. This study provides a methodology for developing
  local impacts-based drought thresholds that can be applied to other regions
  where long-term drought impact records exist to provide regionally
  representative depictions of conditions and improve drought monitoring."
