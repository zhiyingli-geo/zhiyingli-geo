Zhiying Li is a hydroclimatologist, assistant professor in the [O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University Bloomington](https://oneill.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/li-zhiying.html), and PI of the IU Hydroclimatology Group. She works to understand the variability, drivers, and impacts of hydroclimatic extremes, such as drought and flooding, and water availability in a warming climate, using a wide range of approaches, including fully coupled Earth System Models, process-based hydrologic models, hydrologic theory, statistical analysis, and GIS.

She is from southern China, did her postdoctoral training at the Dartmouth Climate Modeling & Impacts Group, and holds degrees from Northwest A&F University, China (Bachelors in Agriculture), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (M.S.), and The Ohio State University (Ph.D.).
