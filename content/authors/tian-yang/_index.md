Tian Yang (she/her) is a Ph.D. student in the Hydroclimatology Group. She is from a small county along the Yellow River in China. Growing up by this great river, she experienced both its dramatic floods and periods of drought. These experiences sparked her interest in hydroclimatology. Her research focuses on the hydrological responses of river basins to climate change, with a particular focus on detection, attribution and projection. She holds a MS from [Shandong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/), China, and a BE from [Taiyuan University of Technology](https://english.tyut.edu.cn/), China.
