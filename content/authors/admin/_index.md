Zhiying Li is a postdoctoral research associate at the Climate Modeling & Impacts Group (CMIG) at the Department of Geography at Dartmouth College. She is a broadly trained physical geographer with a specialization in hydroclimatology. Her work centers on fundamental and applied questions about how climate variability and human intervention are altering the water cycle, including hydroclimatic extremes and water availability. Past research includes investigating drivers of streamflow change, predicting future streamflow patterns, quantifying changes in extreme precipitation, machine learning applications in climatology, etc. She is currently working on assessing the ability of static drought monitoring in a nonstationary climate.
