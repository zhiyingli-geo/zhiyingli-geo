Welcome to the **Hydroclimatology Group** at O'Neill School at Indiana University Bloomington! We are interested in fundamental and applied questions in the interrelations among climate, water, and people. Our group seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of variability, drivers, and impacts of two representations of changes in the water cycle in a warming world: (1) **hydroclimatic extremes** such as drought and flooding, and (2) **water availability.** We use a wide range of approaches including process-based hydrologic models, hydrologic theory, fully coupled Earth System Models, spatiotemporal statistical modeling, machine learning, big data, GIS, and remote sensing. The overarching goal of our research is to inform risk management, climate adaptation, and sustainable development under climate change.

I'm looking for a postdoctoral researcher to join my group and a team of collaborators to study hydrologic intensification and water availability across the continental U.S. [Apply now](https://indiana.peopleadmin.com/postings/29508)!
